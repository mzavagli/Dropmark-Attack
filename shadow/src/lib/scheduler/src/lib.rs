//! Scheduler for Shadow discrete-event simulations.
//!
//! In Shadow, each host has a queue of events it must process, and within a given scheduling round
//! the host can process these events independently of all other hosts. This means that Shadow can
//! process each host in parallel.
//!
//! For a given list of hosts, the scheduler must tell each host to run and process its events. This
//! must occur in parallel with minimal overhead. With a typical thread pool you might create a new
//! task for each host and run all of the tasks on the thread pool, but this is too slow for Shadow
//! and results in a huge runtime performance loss (simulation run time increases by over 10x). Most
//! thread pools also don't have a method of specifying which task (and therefore which host) runs
//! on which CPU core, which is an important performance optimization on NUMA architectures.
//!
//! The scheduler in this library uses a thread pool optimized for running the same task across all
//! threads. This means that the scheduler takes a single function/closure and runs it on each
//! thread simultaneously (and sometimes repeatedly) until all of the hosts have been processed. The
//! implementation details depend on which scheduler is in use ( [`ThreadPerCoreSched`] or
//! [`ThreadPerHostSched`]), but all schedulers share a common interface so that they can easily be
//! switched out.
//!
//! The [`Scheduler`] provides a simple wrapper to make it easier to support both schedulers, which
//! is useful if you want to choose one at runtime. The schedulers use a "[scoped
//! threads][std::thread::scope]" design to simplify the calling code. This helps the calling code
//! share data with the scheduler without requiring the caller to use locking or "unsafe" to do so.
//!
//! ```
//! # use scheduler::thread_per_core::ThreadPerCoreSched;
//! # use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU32, Ordering};
//! # #[derive(Debug)]
//! # struct Host(u16);
//! # impl Host {
//! #     pub fn new(id: u16) -> Self { Self(id) }
//! #     pub fn id(&self) -> u16 { self.0 }
//! #     pub fn run_events(&mut self) {}
//! # }
//! // a simulation with three hosts
//! let hosts = [Host::new(0), Host::new(1), Host::new(2)];
//!
//! // a scheduler with two threads (no cpu pinning) and three hosts
//! let mut sched: ThreadPerCoreSched<Host> =
//!     ThreadPerCoreSched::new(&[None, None], hosts, false);
//!
//! // the counter is owned by this main thread with a non-static lifetime, but
//! // because of the "scoped threads" design it can be accessed by the task in
//! // the scheduler's threads
//! let counter = AtomicU32::new(0);
//!
//! // run one round of the scheduler
//! sched.scope(|s| {
//!     s.run_with_hosts(|thread_idx, hosts| {
//!         hosts.for_each(|mut host| {
//!             println!("Running host {} on thread {thread_idx}", host.id());
//!             host.run_events();
//!             counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
//!             host
//!         });
//!     });
//!
//!     // we can do other processing here in the main thread while we wait for the
//!     // above task to finish running
//!     println!("Waiting for the task to finish on all threads");
//! });
//!
//! println!("Finished processing the hosts");
//!
//! // the `counter.fetch_add(1)` was run once for each host
//! assert_eq!(counter.load(Ordering::Relaxed), 3);
//!
//! // we're done with the scheduler, so join all of its threads
//! sched.join();
//! ```
//!
//! The [`ThreadPerCoreSched`] scheduler is generally much faster and should be preferred over the
//! [`ThreadPerHostSched`] scheduler. If no one finds a situation where the `ThreadPerHostSched` is
//! faster, then it should probably be removed sometime in the future.
//!
//! It's probably good to [`box`][Box] the host since the schedulers move the host frequently, and it's
//! faster to move a pointer than the entire host object.
//!
//! Unsafe code should only be written in the thread pools. The schedulers themselves should be
//! written in only safe code using the safe interfaces provided by the thread pools. If new
//! features are needed in the scheduler, it's recommended to try to add them to the scheduler
//! itself and not modify any of the thread pools. The thread pools are complicated and have
//! delicate lifetime [sub-typing/variance][variance] handling, which is easy to break and would
//! enable the user of the scheduler to invoke undefined behaviour.
//!
//! [variance]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html
//!
//! If the scheduler uses CPU pinning, the task can get the CPU its pinned to using
//! [`core_affinity`].
