  o Major bugfixes (guard usage):
    - When Tor excluded a guard due to temporary circuit restrictions,
      it considered *additional* primary guards for potential usage
      by that circuit. This could result in more than the specified number
      of guards (currently 2) being used, long-term, by the tor client.
      This could happen when a Guard was also selected as an Exit node,
      but it was exacerbated by the Conflux guard restrictions. Both
      instances have been fixed. Fixes bug 40876; bugfix on 0.3.0.1-alpha.
