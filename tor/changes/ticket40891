  o Minor feature (directory authority):
    - Allow BandwidthFiles "node_id" KeyValue without the dollar sign at the
      start of the hexdigit, in order to easier database queries combining
      Tor documents in which the relays fingerprint does not include it.
      Fixes bug 40891; bugfix on 0.4.7 (all supported versions of Tor).
