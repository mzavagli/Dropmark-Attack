  o Removed features (directory authority):
    - We include a new consensus method that removes support for
      computing "package" lines in consensus documents.  This feature was
      never used, and support for
      including it in our votes was removed in 0.4.2.1-alpha.
      Finishes implementation of proposal 301.
